Steps for Migrating a production portal to AWS

Advance work
- copy the production database to AWS a new DB in AWS lets call it [project_name]-staging
- create a new staging ec2 instance that is using this database
- have people test it out

Prepare before disabling production site:
- reduce the ttl in dns
- allocate a new elastic ip and let it rest
- create a new production db on aws: script/create_db.rb (need to set the db name in the production role)
- create a new ec2 production instance: script/create_ec2.rb
- run fix node:[ec2 instance dns] role:[projecname]-production (change db name in role to [project_name]-staging)
- create a new capistrono config for [project_name]-production-aws
- run cap [project_name]-production-aws deploy

Actual down time work
- put up the maintence screen on interactions production: cap [project_name]-production disable_web
- run the command to copy the production database to AWS
- switch chef role to point to new db: [project_name]-production
- run fix node:[ec2 instance dns] role:[projecname]-production
- run cap migrate
