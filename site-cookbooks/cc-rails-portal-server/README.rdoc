= Notes about setting a cc-rails-portal-server

Currently the cc-rails-portal-server uses an AWS RDS database
This is hardcoded in the templates of this cookbook.

It also uses an AWS SES smtp setup. The credentials for this are
pulled from variables somewhere...
talk to Scott to get them if you need them.
We currently only have the ability to send to concord.org email addresses through AWS SES.
